# EndlessRunner

**EndlessRunner** is a fast-paced action game where you run through dodging obstacles and collecting power-ups. As the speed increases, so does the challengeâ€”how far can you go?

This game is made by me using Unreal Engine 5.4 and Blueprints.I didn't created any assets used in this game, I have only uploaded assets which were already available online.

This game was part of my learning process and i have developed this game by watching [Shiva's Gaming Zone's](https://www.youtube.com/@shivasgamingzone) tutorial playlist [Unreal Engine 5 Endless Runner Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tI7Z2tI7yYKn4irjkTEeEyH0Kblzv6C).
